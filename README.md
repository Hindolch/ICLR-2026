MY CURRENT THOUGHTS REGARDING THE EXPERIMENTS

Orderliness & The Mental Number Line: Mechanistic Interpretability
Activation patching: Can you restore orderliness in deep layers by patching in activations from shallow layers?
Causal mediation: Which attention heads or MLP neurons are responsible for maintaining/destroying orderliness?
Mechanistic circuit tracing: Use activation patching + attention head attribution to identify which components maintain orderliness. Build a "circuit diagram" of the mental number line.

AND CHECK THE ORIGINAL REPO BY AUTHORS FOR THEIR METRICES AND DATASET IF WE USE THAT ONLY
